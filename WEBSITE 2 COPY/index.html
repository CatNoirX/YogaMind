                   <p class="text-small"> Yoga is a mind and body practice with a 5,000-year history in ancient Indian philosophy. Various styles of yoga combine physical postures, breathing techniques, and meditation or relaxation.
                    Yoga is an exercise involving breathing, meditation, and physical postures. It is also very essential that these exercises should be in the right proportion for the benefits of yoga to be visible. Yoga is as beneficial to the mind as it is to the body. It tones the body and relaxes the mind up to the level of spirituality as claimed by yoga gurus and followers.

                    There are a total of more than a thousand poses of yoga and it focuses on several things like – relaxing the mind, de-stressing, confidence buildup, relief from specific body pain, etc. There are specific yoga techniques to treat diabetes, blood pressure, migraine, hypertension, etc. Those who are healthy and do not have any of these medical conditions are also recommended to perform yoga to prevent them in the future.
                    
                    Practicing yoga lets you take full control of your mind. It stays composed, calm and concentrated. Yoga originated thousands of years back in India and has been since then passed on from generation to generation.
                    
                    Yoga keeps your mind from wandering away and helps to keep it calm and composed. It develops harmony in your mind and body. Basically yoga is a technique to control your mind and body through different breathing patterns.
                    The most wonderful thing about yoga is that it can be practiced by anyone at any place. The only fundamental requirement is that it should be performed in a clean environment. You can use a yoga mat if you want else grass or sand will just be fine.
                    It has become so popular that there are yoga teaching classes running in every nook and corner of India.

Not only in India but the magic of yoga has also spread to the other parts of the world and over 300 million people throughout the globe, practice it daily. With the number of people practicing yoga, it is evident that it is indeed beneficial to health. Had yoga not been advantageous, it wouldn’t have gained so much popularity so quickly.

                    There is also no fixed time limit for yoga practice; however, any form of yoga should be practiced at least 15–20 minutes regularly, to see the benefits. Today yoga has become extremely popular not only in its country of origin, India but also all over the world. Around 300 million people practice yoga around the globe. </p>

                <p>▪️ The Sun Salutation is a graceful sequence of twelve positions performed as one continuous flow.
                    Each position counteracts the one before, stretching the body in a different way and alternately
                    expanding and contracting the chest to regulate the breathing.</p>
                <p> ▪️ The sequence also flexes and stretches the spinal column through their maximum range giving
                    profound stretch to the whole body.
                    Practiced daily it will bring great flexibility to your spine and joints and trim your waist.</p>
                <p> ▪️ It limbers up the whole body in preparation for the other Asanas (postures) that are practiced as
                    part of a regular yoga routine.
                    Repeat 5-10 times (or more) bringing the right leg back then forth first THEN left leg back then
                    forth.</p>

                <p>Known as the base of all standing poses, it gives you a sense of grounding and a feel of the earth.
                    Most of the standing poses emerge from Tadasana. Though it seems like just a “simple standing pose”,
                    a lot of things go with the pose. Though it is not mandatory to do this asana on an empty stomach if
                    you precede or follow it up with other Yoga asanas, then it is best to have a four to six hours gap
                    between your meals and this asana.</p>

                    asana looks similar to how a dog looks when it bends forward, hence the name “Downward Facing Dog

                    revive your faith in your lower half of the body when you feel that you are disconnected with it.
                    This asana increases strength and balance on your legs, feet, and torso resulting in making your
                    mind even and steady.</p>

                    Yoga posture will help you channelize your thoughts in a single direction, aiding concentration.</p>

                <p>Savasana is a relaxed yoga posture. In Savasana (Corpse Pose) you are relaxed but in a state of
                    awareness. You are aware of your breath, the different parts of your body and your inner strength.
                    To boost concentration, all you need is to practice savasana regularly for 10 minutes, it helps you
                    reboot and feel alive.
                    So, these were the 10 yoga asanas for beginners. If you are a beginner, then you must try these
                    simple asanas. Make sure that you practice these asanas under the guidance of a yoga instructor ( at
                    least in the beginning) and when you master them, you can practice them at your home. This was
                    Priyanka Sukhwani here. Stay tuned with Buzzarenas and if you have any queries regarding these
